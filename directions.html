                    <p> Below, you will find directions to get to HackRU. HackRU is being held at
                        <address> 
                            <strong>Douglass Campus Center </strong><br />

                    </p>

                    <p>Note: There is a Rutgers Football Game going on starting at noon on Saturday, October 13th. This means that you may experience unusually high traffic while trying to get to HackRU. It will mostly affect traffic that's not going to Douglass Campus, but you should leave yourself with some extra travel time.</p>

                    <h2> Getting there from outside Rutgers </h2>

                    <h3> Public Transport </h3>

                    <p> If you're taking public transportation to HackRU, you will want to arrive at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick_(NJT_station)"> New Brunswick Train Station </a>. This is on the <a href="http://www.njtransit.com/rg/rg_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=LineDetailsTo&amp;selLine=NEC">Northeast Corridor Line for NJTransit </a>, and connects to New York Penn Station, and Trenton station. </p>
                    <p> From Philadelphia, you will want to take the Septa over to Trenton train station, and the Northeast Corridor Line to the New Brunswick Train Station. </p>

                    <p> Once you're at the New Brunswick Train Station, you can take the <b> Weekend 2 </b> Rutgers bus, from the train station to Cabaret Theater. We will also have several organizers driving around the area before the start of the hackathon (1:30 - 1:45pm), so you can give us a call at (732)-725-2998 and we'll be happy to drive you over.</p>

                    <h3> Driving </h3>
