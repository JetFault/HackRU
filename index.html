              <h3>What is HackRU?</h3>
              <p>HackRU is a 24 hour coding competition. Students work alone or in small teams to envision, create, and demo an application. Sponsor companies present APIs that can be utilized by the teams to make their applications, and mentor hackers in building their vision. At the end of 24 hours hackers and sponsors huddle together with a panel of judges who award prizes for design, inginuity, and sheer guts.</p>
              <p>HackRU is organized by the Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists (USACS). What started as a small event, held in empty classrooms, and scraped together by passionate hackers has evolved into a huge inter-school event. Now sponsoring companies of the event have reached out to not only generously financially support the education and cultural celebration that is HackRU, but also as a chance to connect with students of our community.</p>
