				<h2>Help Sponsor HackRU</h2>
				<p>The Rutgers Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists (USACS) is for a third year holding HackRU and they need your help. HackRU is a 24 hour classic hackathon dedicated to celebrating Rutgers distinct hacking culture, connecting students to awesome tech companies, and most importantly, educating and motivating student hackers to go out and build something. We choose a small number of companies this year that we believed both inspired and cared about the Rutgers tech community. We, as students, are asking you to help us help our peers.</p>
				<p>Below are a series of suggested sponsorship packages. We hope that you will take the time to look over these and support us however much you can.</p>
